		<h2>Welcome to Skateboard helpcenter for beginners!</h2>
		<p><i>"Skateboarding is poetry of motion."<br><br>
-Stevie Williams</i></p>
		<p>At skateboard helpcenter you can learn everything you need to start skating!</p>
		<p>Fact is <b>anyone</b> can skate! All you need to do is get yourself a skateboard,
		go outside and start rolling!<br><br>
			<i>"I was a real skateboarder - not a gifted skateboarder. I represented that skateboarding was fun to do by being terrible at it."
<br><br>-Lance Mountain</i></p>
<p><i>The beauty of skating is that everybody has a unique set of variables that they can put in place and express their individual identity in the form of - call it - greatness.<br><br>
-Rodney Mullen</i></p>
<p>Once you get the hang of it, you can play a game of SKATE with your friends!<br><br>What's skate? It's a game where you start with rock paper scissors, and the winner starts off by doing any trick they know. Others need to recreate that trick or they get a letter. Once all letters of SKATE are through, youre out!</p>
